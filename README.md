# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
<!-- V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. -->

## Results
<!-- Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. -->

## Summary
<!-- Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. -->
